Calculation of gravitational microlensing ephemeris based on Gaia dr3

The program is built on functions and classes.
As input data it takes the ID of the lens and source from Gaia dr3, the mass of the lens with an error and the moment of time at which the ephemeris should be calculated.
The initial data is entered at the very bottom of the program.

 At the output we get the angular distance between the stars, the Einstein radius and the microlensing ephemeris for the resolved, unresolved and partially resolved case.
